## Budget Anchors

- **Team Costs:** Core infra developers, protocol researchers, legal/ops retainers.
- **Validator Incentives:** Off-chain stipend paid quarterly based on uptime and stake commitments.
- **Security & Audits:** Reserve 15–20% of total raise for audits, monitoring, and crisis drills.
- **Buffer:** Maintain ≥ 4 months operating expenses unallocated for volatility.

## Governance Cadence

- **Monthly** — DAO-lite review session (proposal rehearsal, ops metrics).
- **Quarterly** — Board-level checkpoint with entity directors.
- **Ad-hoc** — Emergency sessions triggered by risk committee only.

> Keep spend gated until funding milestones hit. Update runway math every month: `Runway (months) = Cash on hand / Monthly burn`.
