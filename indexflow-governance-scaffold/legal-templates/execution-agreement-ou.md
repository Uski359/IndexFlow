# Execution Agreement (Estonia OÜ Variant)

> **Non-binding template for evaluation only. Replace with counsel-reviewed language before execution.**

## Parties
- **Company:** IndexFlow OÜ (pending registration), acting through its board.
- **DAO-lite:** Off-chain governance committee operating under the DAO-lite charter.

## Scope
- DAO-lite proposes operational initiatives (validators, grants, tooling).
- Company reviews proposals for compliance, taxation, and banking readiness.
- Upon written approval, Company executes payments or signs third-party agreements.

## Responsibilities
- Company maintains bank accounts, regulatory filings, and accounting.
- DAO-lite keeps proposal logs, vote attestations, and KPI tracking.
- Both parties coordinate on incident response, audits, and disclosures.

## Term & Termination
- Agreement activates post-entity formation and concludes when a full DAO or alternative legal wrapper supersedes the scaffold.
- Either party may suspend execution authority with 7-day notice.

## Risk Statement
- No on-chain commitments are made via this agreement.
- All funds remain under Company custody until successor governance is installed.

*TODO: Insert governing law, dispute resolution, and signature blocks after counsel review.*
